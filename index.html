        <h2>Utah, United States</h2>

        <p>Utah is home to wide range of diverse ecosystems, from red rock deserts in the south to snow-covered
            mountains in the north. This variety makes Utah a haven for outdoor enthusiasts. With five national parks,
            and dozens of state parks, there is always someplace for exploration and adventure.</p>
